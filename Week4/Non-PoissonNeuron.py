Notes to self to fix mistakes:
The correct answer was Neuron 3 becasue it violated Poisson statistics in a more meaningful way.
High Fano factor (variability > mean) does not always mean non-Poisson.... instead, a neuron can deviate from Poisson behavior due to:
Bursting activity (firing in irregular, non-random patterns), Refractory period effects (reducing variance in a non-Poisson way)
and Non-stationarity in firing rates (changing firing patterns over time).

Even if Neuron 1 had a numerically higher deviation from 1, Neuron 3â€™s firing properties likely made it a better candidate.
